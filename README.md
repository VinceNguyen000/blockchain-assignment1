# blockchain-assignment1 - Extend the Mini Blockchain

# to edit the code: code blockchain.js

# to run the code: node blockchain.js

# Hashing & Immutability: hashing creates immutability by linking each block to one before,
# forming a temper-evident and permanent data chain.

# Why does Proof-of-work make blockchains secure?
# By making blockchain computationally and impractically for alter transaction history.
# The mechannism relies on a network of decentralized mineys who compete to solve complex
# cryptographic puzzles to validate and add new blocks of transactions to the chain.
#
# Proof-of-Work prevent attacks by:
# 1. prevent double-spend attack: by recording all transactions; accepting the longest chain; enormous cost.
# 1.1 recording all transactions: every transaction is broadcast to network, once validated, record
# permanently on blockchain.
# 1.2 accepting the longest chain: accept the longest as the valid transaction history, the most Proof-of-Work
# 1.3 enormous cost: to double-spend, attacker has to create longer, fraudulent version of blockchain-> computationally
# and financially prohibitive
#
# What suprised me while coding this?
# The mini blockchain has simple code, easy to create, and to understand.
